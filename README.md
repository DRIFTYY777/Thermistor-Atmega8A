# Thermistor Temperature Display Project üå°Ô∏è

## Overview

This project uses an **Atmega8A** microcontroller to measure temperature using a **10k thermistor**. The thermistor is connected to the **A2 pin** through a **10k voltage divider**. The **analog-to-digital converter (ADC)** of the Atmega8A reads the voltage, converts it to temperature, and displays it on a **0.92" OLED display**.

## Hardware Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Microcontroller:** Atmega8A
* **Thermistor:** 10k
* **Voltage Divider:** 10k resistor
* **OLED Display:** 0.92"
* **Power Supply:** 9V battery regulated to 3.3V
* **Additional Components:**
    * Capacitor on the analog pin (for stable ADC readings)
    * ON/OFF switch

### Circuit Diagram

This setup ensures a stable and accurate temperature reading. The 3.3V regulation is crucial for the 10k resistor in the voltage divider to provide a stable voltage, preventing fluctuations that could affect the final temperature value.

## Key Considerations

* **Stable ADC Values:** Best practices were followed to ensure stable and accurate ADC readings. This includes using a capacitor on the analog pin and verifying the internal voltage reference.
* **Voltage Regulation:** The device operates on 3.3V, regulated from a 9V battery to ensure stable voltage for the 10k resistor and accurate temperature readings.
