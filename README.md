Write me a professional readme file for my github soo i can copy or paste project in which im using 10k thermistor connected to A2 pin of atmega8a via 10k voltage divider getting adc converting it into temperature and displaying it on oled display 0.92, i followed the best practices of getting stable and true adc value using documented cap on analog pin making sure internal voltage refrence is correct the device is working on 3.3v regulating voltage from 9v battery eith onn off switch why 3.3v make sure 10k resistor get stable voltage soo it doset affect final value  also there are 3 images in directory here the link also add those under readme file
